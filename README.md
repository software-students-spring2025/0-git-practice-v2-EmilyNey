### Summary
This article outlines a major security vulnerability in Subaru's STARLINK program that revealed customer data within the US, Canada, and Japan. The authors of this article were able to uncover location data, exporting a year's worth of location history, and add themselves as an authorized user on a friend's Subaru, allowing them to remotely unlock the car. They did all of this without needing any confirmation from the actual owner. Subaru patched the vulnerability within 24 hours before it was able to be exploited maliciously. 
While this article is more related to information security than SWE specifically, it does highlight how seemingly simple actions like finding exposed JavaScript files can lead to major security breaches, and emphasizes the importance of securing even the smaller parts of a system.
